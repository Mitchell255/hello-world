# hello-world
A place for code snippets and ideas
I've worked with computers in some fashion since the mid 1980's.  I learned in an MS DOS environment and I've been struggling to keep up with technology ever since.  I was frustrated when Bill Gates came out with Windows and incensed when Microsoft Word replaced WordPerfet.  Now that PowerBI and Tableau have taken over the database environment and my MS Access skills seem to be going the way of the dinosauer, I find myself turning in circles and wondering what I should be learning next so I can stay in the game.
